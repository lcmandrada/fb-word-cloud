# Note

The repository only includes a jupyter notebook containing the static code, a set of Filipino stopwords from [stopwords-iso](https://github.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-tl), and a list of translated Filipino stopwords from nltk's English stopwords. Other resources were not uploaded for privacy.

The image uploaded here is not the direct output of the code. The individual outputs were consolidated through photoshop.
